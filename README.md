This code is the implementation of a paper which is about constructing higher order mimetic finite difference approximations of differential operators on non uniform grids. 
We are using the mapping method to first map the non uniform grid to a uniform grid and then approximating the Gradient and Laplacian on it and then mapping back the result to the non unform grid. 
I have also plotted the uniform grid, non uniform grid, gradient and Laplacian over non unform grid.
